### If this Project/Class helped you in your own Project, don't mind starring the original repository, found here: https://github.com/TheLeftExit/TheLeftExit.Memory

Using this class you don't have to Pointer Scan anymore for values sitting in named structures. Given you found your Values once, and noticed that the Structure they were in got a name, let's say, using the Cheat Engine's Feature **dissect data/structures** found in Memory Viewer > Tools, this will return you working and up-to-date pointers.

This comes with it's own rpm/wpm capabilities, so you technically don't have to rely on other Memory Libs. If you want to improve this project, fork it from here: https://github.com/TheLeftExit/TheLeftExit.Memory

Usage:
```csharp
